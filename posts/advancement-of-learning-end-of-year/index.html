Take in:</p><ul><li>the rhythms</li><li>the changes</li><li>the final image</li></ul><p>Feel your way through it. There&rsquo;s a version of it <a href=https://www.brinkerhoffpoetry.org/poems/an-advancement-of-learning>here</a>.</p><p>Have you read it now? Great:</p><p>Now, grab a notebook, <em>something to write on</em> — something offline if possible. This blog post is your guide, your structure, your worksheet. Follow it actively: write headings, jot down thoughts, underline what matters.</p><p>Case in point: <strong>Give yourself a title.</strong> You could just title this note <em>&lsquo;An Advancement of Learning&rsquo; by Seamus Heaney</em>.</p><p>Now here is your first subtitle, because we&rsquo;re going to begin with a very important question 👇</p><hr><h3 id=1-whats-it-about-what><strong>1. What&rsquo;s it about? (WHAT)</strong></h3><p>That&rsquo;s your subtitle, by the way 👆: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it about?&rdquo; Did I mention that? Write it down.</p><h4 id=generating-initial-ideas>Generating initial ideas</h4><p>Now here&rsquo;s your first &rsquo;engagement&rsquo; with the poem. I&rsquo;m going to ask you to <em>write</em> something.</p><p><strong>In your own words:</strong> what do you think this poem is about?</p><p>Be <em>fearless</em> here. Just write. You can start by being <em>literal</em> - and maybe you will branch out into something more adventurous. Just write: nobody is judging you here. The only person going to be doing the judging is <em>you</em>.</p><p>How much? <strong>Aim for 100 words.</strong> If that sounds like a lot then do what you can. Then come back here.</p><p>Done now? Got something written down? If so - we can move onto the next stage&mldr; [So here is your next subtitle 👇]</p><h4 id=enhancing-your-ideas>Enhancing your ideas</h4><p>Got that? Written it down? 👆</p><p>Now - <em>this is where the magic happens</em>:</p><p><strong>Let’s better define your thinking:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Browse the word lists below</strong></li><li><strong>Jot down</strong> any words which you think are a <strong>good fit</strong> in identifying <em>something</em> that is <em>in</em> the poem.</li><li>When you&rsquo;re done, continue to the next section (below the word list).</li></ol><h5 id=word-lists-to-promote-sharper-thinking>Word lists to promote sharper thinking:</h5><p><strong>Challenge</strong>: fear, confrontation, anxiety, ordeal, courage, humiliation<br><strong>Control</strong>: tension, force, constraint, pressure, loss of control<br><strong>Emotion</strong>: disgust, anger, shame, relief, triumph<br><strong>Maturity</strong>: advancement, rite of passage, initiation, threshold, transformation<br><strong>Conflict</strong>: resistance, deadlock, defiance, surrender, domination<br><strong>Power</strong>: authority, assertion, submission, encounter, standoff<br><strong>Growth</strong>: awakening, self-knowledge, self-possession, insight, clarity</p><h4 id=revising-and-improving-your-answer>Revising and improving your answer</h4><p>Got your list of &lsquo;good fit&rsquo; words written down? Good. Now <em>write out the subtitle above</em>. <strong>We&rsquo;re building a meaningful set of notes</strong> that you can consult later on - to <strong>remember the thinking process</strong> we went through.</p><p><em>Now</em> have <strong>a fresh go</strong> at summarising <em>what the poem is about</em>.</p><h5 id=tips>Tips:</h5><ol><li><p>You might find it helpful to ask this time:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it <em>really</em> about?&rdquo;</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Try to work into your writing <strong>some of the fresh vocabulary</strong> you&rsquo;ve just identified.</p></li></ol><h4 id=reflecting-on-how-your-answer-changed---and-why>Reflecting on how your answer changed - and why</h4><p><strong>Reflect:</strong></p><ul><li><em>How</em> did your second answer change?</li><li>Is it better?</li><li>Which of the &rsquo;new&rsquo; words did you use?</li><li>Which version feels <em>closer to the truth</em>?</li><li>Which was easier to write — and why?</li></ul><p><strong>Other useful questions to ask here are:</strong></p><ul><li>Were the &rsquo;new&rsquo; words you used really &rsquo;new&rsquo;? Did you know them already?</li><li>What <em>prevented</em> you from using them in the first place?</li></ul><p>That last question isn&rsquo;t supposed to sound rhetorical or judgmental&mdash;it&rsquo;s a genuine question. You might feel that the answer is:</p><blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t really know - I just didn&rsquo;t think of it&mldr; But now I know that &lsquo;conflict&rsquo; is a thing that appears in poetry, maybe I&rsquo;ll be better at spotting one next time?</p></blockquote><p>And that would be a win!</p><h4 id=ready-to-move-on>Ready to move on</h4><p>We&rsquo;ve now done something crucial:</p><p><strong>We&rsquo;ve established some of the things that the poem is <em>really</em> about.</strong></p><ul><li>We haven&rsquo;t treated it like a crossword puzzle or a code.</li><li>We haven&rsquo;t looked for any &lsquo;hidden meanings&rsquo;.</li></ul><p>We&rsquo;ve just used ordinary English words that felt like a &lsquo;good fit&rsquo; for what&rsquo;s <em>going on</em> and <em>what we&rsquo;re seeing</em> in the poem.</p><p><strong>In other words, we have established the poem&rsquo;s <em>content</em>.</strong></p><p>So here is your next subtitle: 👇</p><hr><h3 id=2-how-is-the-content-presented-how><strong>2. How is the content presented? (HOW)</strong></h3><p>Got your subtitle written down? 👆</p><p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got a proper grasp of the actual <em>content</em> and <em>meaning</em> of the poem, let&rsquo;s have a look at how that content is <em>shaped</em> and <em>dramatised</em> through poetic style.</p><p>This is the bit that we might call &rsquo;looking for techniques&rsquo;.</p><blockquote><p>This activity is nicer if you can get hold of <strong>a paper copy</strong> of <a href=https://www.brinkerhoffpoetry.org/poems/an-advancement-of-learning>the poem</a> (or screenshot and annotate it on a device): <em>Otherwise</em>, you can write your notes like this (I&rsquo;ve gifted you a few here!):</p><ul><li><strong>Imagery:</strong> &ldquo;A transfer of gables and sky&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Onomatopoeia:</strong> &ldquo;slobbered&rdquo;, &ldquo;slimed&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Alliteration:</strong> &ldquo;<strong>c</strong>urtly, <strong>c</strong>lose&rdquo;</li></ul></blockquote><p>This is where you apply all the tools you&rsquo;ve been taught in the past&mdash;use them!</p><p>Try to get at least 10 different technical observations.</p><p>Done that? Then you&rsquo;re ready to move onto the next phase - where we explore how those techniques are effective or meaningful <em>in the context of all the ideas we generated <strong>about the content.</strong></em></p><p>Get that subtitle written down! 👇</p><hr><h3 id=3-bring-it-all-together-what--how--why><strong>3. Bring it all together (WHAT > HOW > WHY)</strong></h3><p>This is what we&rsquo;ve really been building up to&mdash;the bit where we say something meaningful about the poem AND explain how it&rsquo;s made effective and dramatic.</p><h4 id=time-to-write>Time to write</h4><p>Choose one of the four paragraph prompts (below). They all focus on different parts of the poem.</p><blockquote><ul><li>Use the paragraph <em>scaffolding</em> provided further below</li><li>Be focused and <strong>economical</strong></li><li>Aim for <strong>120–150 words</strong></li><li>Don&rsquo;t forget to make use of your thinking from <strong>both</strong> the previous steps we have been through!</li><li>Did you read that last bullet point? You <em>have</em> to build on the thinking you&rsquo;ve already done: <strong>this is where lots of people fall down.</strong></li></ul></blockquote><h4 id=paragraph-prompts>Paragraph prompts:</h4><p><strong>Option 1 (Stanzas 3 & 4):</strong><br>How does Heaney <em>characterise</em> his <em>initial detection</em> and <em>reaction</em> to the rat? (e.g. thoughts, feelings, behaviour)</p><p><strong>Option 2 (Stanza 5):</strong><br>How does Heaney make his <em>behaviour</em> and <em>attitude</em> <em>seem</em> here? Could this be a turning point?</p><p><strong>Option 3 (Stanzas 6 & 7):</strong><br>How does Heaney present <em>the appearance</em> of the rat? What effect does the imagery have?</p><p><strong>Option 4:</strong><br>Choose two stanzas of your own and write about what you find interesting or effective.</p><h4 id=structure-your-paragraph-like-this>Structure your paragraph like this:</h4><blockquote><p><strong>WHAT:</strong> <strong>Clear main point</strong> that answers the question you chose – you want <em>everything that comes next</em> to support/demonstrate this point!</p><p><strong>HOW:</strong> <strong>Example 1:</strong></p><p><em><strong>For example…</strong></em> – then offer your first quotation:</p><ul><li>Try to explain <em>why</em> your example is important – using technical detail if possible.</li></ul><p><strong>HOW:</strong> <strong>Example 2:</strong></p><p><strong>“Similarly…”</strong> – now introduce another quotation to reinforce your main point</p><ul><li>Again, try to explain <em>why</em> your example is important – using technical detail
if possible.</li></ul><p><strong>HOW:</strong> <strong>Example 3</strong> (if you can):</p><p><strong>“Furthermore”</strong> – see if you can throw in a further piece of evidence that supports your main idea.</p><ul><li>Once again, try to explain why your example is important – using technical detail if possible.</li></ul><p><strong>WHY</strong>: <strong>Explain</strong> <em>why</em> do you think Heaney has done all this? Explain in your own words.</p><ul><li><strong>Important:</strong> People sometimes get stuck here. To support yourself here:<ul><li><em>Look back at the writing you did earlier</em>. There is a good chance - if you are patient and prepared <em>to think</em> that <em>something</em> you thought or wrote earlier will help you here - something to do with what the poem is <em>about</em>.</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><hr><h3 id=4-why-this-poem-now-reflect><strong>4. Why this poem now? (REFLECT)</strong></h3><p>Paragraph written? If so &mdash; well done. You probably had to think hard and expend effort, didn&rsquo;t you?</p><p>You can put your pen down now. But I&rsquo;d like you to consider the following - as a way of winding down and giving broader meaning to what we&rsquo;ve just done:</p><p>I often teach this poem at the end of the year.</p><p><em>Why do you think that is?</em></p><ul><li><p>What kind of &lsquo;bridge&rsquo; has the speaker crossed?</p></li><li><p>What bridges have you crossed this year &mdash; at school, with friends or family, in your life?</p></li><li><p>And finally: did any of the words you picked from the word lists help to act as a &lsquo;bridge&rsquo; for you today? Can you explain how?</p></li></ul><hr><h3 id=5-conclusion>5. Conclusion</h3><p>The purpose of the routine we&rsquo;ve just been through is to illustrate that <strong>poetry analysis is not about decoding; it&rsquo;s about <em>recognition</em>.</strong> It’s about noticing what you <em>almost</em> understand — and finding the words to bring it closer.</p><p>That’s not just a reading skill. It’s a life skill.</p><p>Let me know how you get on.</p></div></article>
