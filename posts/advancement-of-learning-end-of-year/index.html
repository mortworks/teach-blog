<meta name=keywords content><meta name=description content="Title: Crossing the Bridge: How to think (and write) about a poem
This is a poem I like to teach towards the end of an academic year. If you&rsquo;re reading this near to the end of an academic year, then&mldr;
&mldr;you&rsquo;re standing at a kind of bridge —
one between this year and next.
So let&rsquo;s read a poem about a boy who crosses a literal bridge, after facing something that he&rsquo;s always feared."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://mortworks.github.io/teach-blog/posts/advancement-of-learning-end-of-year/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/teach-blog/assets/css/stylesheet.f49d66caae9ea0fd43f21f29e71a8d3e284517ed770f2aa86fa012953ad3c9ef.css integrity="sha256-9J1myq6eoP1D8h8p5xqNPihFF+13Dyqob6ASlTrTye8=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://mortworks.github.io/teach-blog/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://mortworks.github.io/teach-blog/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://mortworks.github.io/teach-blog/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://mortworks.github.io/teach-blog/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://mortworks.github.io/teach-blog/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://mortworks.github.io/teach-blog/posts/advancement-of-learning-end-of-year/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://mortworks.github.io/teach-blog/posts/advancement-of-learning-end-of-year/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="PWM Teach-Blog"><meta property="og:title" content="Crossing the Bridge: How to think (and write) about a poem"><meta property="og:description" content="Title: Crossing the Bridge: How to think (and write) about a poem

If you’re reading this near to the end of an academic year, then…\n…you’re standing at a kind of bridge —\none between this year and next.\nSo let’s read a poem about a boy who crosses a literal bridge, after facing something that he’s always feared.\nThis is Seamus Heaney’s ‘An Advancement of Learning’ — and it’s a brilliant poem to end the year on.\nBut first—read the poem. Just read it. Silently once, then aloud if you can. Take in:\nthe rhythms the changes the final image Feel your way through it. There’s a version of it here.\nHave you read it now? Great:\nNow, grab a notebook, something to write on — something offline if possible. This blog post is your guide, your structure, your worksheet. Follow it actively: write headings, jot down thoughts, underline what matters.\nCase in point: Give yourself a title. You could just title this note ‘An Advancement of Learning’ by Seamus Heaney.\nNow here is your first subtitle, because we’re going to begin with a very important question 👇\n1. What’s it about? (WHAT) That’s your subtitle, by the way 👆: “What’s it about?” Did I mention that? Write it down.\nGenerating initial ideas Now here’s your first ’engagement’ with the poem. I’m going to ask you to write something.\nIn your own words: what do you think this poem is about?\nBe fearless here. Just write. You can start by being literal - and maybe you will branch out into something more adventurous. Just write: nobody is judging you here. The only person going to be doing the judging is you.\nHow much? Aim for 100 words. If that sounds like a lot then do what you can. Then come back here.\nDone now? Got something written down? If so - we can move onto the next stage… [So here is your next subtitle 👇]\nEnhancing your ideas Got that? Written it down? 👆\nNow - this is where the magic happens:\nLet’s better define your thinking:\nBrowse the word lists below Jot down any words which you think are a good fit in identifying something that is in the poem. When you’re done, continue to the next section (below the word list). Word lists to promote sharper thinking: Challenge: fear, confrontation, anxiety, ordeal, courage, humiliation\nControl: tension, force, constraint, pressure, loss of control\nEmotion: disgust, anger, shame, relief, triumph\nMaturity: advancement, rite of passage, initiation, threshold, transformation\nConflict: resistance, deadlock, defiance, surrender, domination\nPower: authority, assertion, submission, encounter, standoff\nGrowth: awakening, self-knowledge, self-possession, insight, clarity\nRevising and improving your answer Got your list of ‘good fit’ words written down? Good. Now write out the subtitle above. We’re building a meaningful set of notes that you can consult later on - to remember the thinking process we went through.\nNow have a fresh go at summarising what the poem is about.\nTips: You might find it helpful to ask this time:\n“What’s it really about?”\nTry to work into your writing some of the fresh vocabulary you’ve just identified.\nReflecting on how your answer changed - and why Reflect:\nHow did your second answer change? Is it better? Which of the ’new’ words did you use? Which version feels closer to the truth? Which was easier to write — and why? Other useful questions to ask here are:\nWere the ’new’ words you used really ’new’? Did you know them already? What prevented you from using them in the first place? That last question isn’t supposed to sound rhetorical or judgmental—it’s a genuine question. You might feel that the answer is:\nI don’t really know - I just didn’t think of it… But now I know that ‘conflict’ is a thing that appears in poetry, maybe I’ll be better at spotting one next time?\nAnd that would be a win!\nReady to move on We’ve now done something crucial:\nWe’ve established some of the things that the poem is really about.\nWe haven’t treated it like a crossword puzzle or a code. We haven’t looked for any ‘hidden meanings’. We’ve just used ordinary English words that felt like a ‘good fit’ for what’s going on and what we’re seeing in the poem.\nIn other words, we have established the poem’s content.\nSo here is your next subtitle: 👇\n2. How is the content presented? (HOW) Got your subtitle written down? 👆\nNow that you’ve got a proper grasp of the actual content and meaning of the poem, let’s have a look at how that content is shaped and dramatised through poetic style.\nThis is the bit that we might call ’looking for techniques’.\nThis activity is nicer if you can get hold of a paper copy of the poem (or screenshot and annotate it on a device): Otherwise, you can write your notes like this (I’ve gifted you a few here!):\nImagery: “A transfer of gables and sky” Onomatopoeia: “slobbered”, “slimed” Alliteration: “curtly, close” This is where you apply all the tools you’ve been taught in the past—use them!\nTry to get at least 10 different technical observations.\nDone that? Then you’re ready to move onto the next phase - where we explore how those techniques are effective or meaningful in the context of all the ideas we generated about the content.\nGet that subtitle written down! 👇\n3. Bring it all together (WHAT \u003e HOW \u003e WHY) This is what we’ve really been building up to—the bit where we say something meaningful about the poem AND explain how it’s made effective and dramatic.\nTime to write Choose one of the four paragraph prompts (below). They all focus on different parts of the poem.\nUse the paragraph scaffolding provided further below Be focused and economical Aim for 120–150 words Don’t forget to make use of your thinking from both the previous steps we have been through! Did you read that last bullet point? You have to build on the thinking you’ve already done: this is where lots of people fall down. Paragraph prompts: Option 1 (Stanzas 3 \u0026 4):\nHow does Heaney characterise his initial detection and reaction to the rat? (e.g. thoughts, feelings, behaviour)\nOption 2 (Stanza 5):\nHow does Heaney make his behaviour and attitude seem here? Could this be a turning point?\nOption 3 (Stanzas 6 \u0026 7):\nHow does Heaney present the appearance of the rat? What effect does the imagery have?\nOption 4:\nChoose two stanzas of your own and write about what you find interesting or effective.\nStructure your paragraph like this: WHAT: Clear main point that answers the question you chose – you want everything that comes next to support/demonstrate this point!\nHOW: Example 1:\nFor example… – then offer your first quotation:\nTry to explain why your example is important – using technical detail if possible. HOW: Example 2:\n“Similarly…” – now introduce another quotation to reinforce your main point\nAgain, try to explain why your example is important – using technical detail if possible. HOW: Example 3 (if you can):\n“Furthermore” – see if you can throw in a further piece of evidence that supports your main idea.\nOnce again, try to explain why your example is important – using technical detail if possible. WHY: Explain why do you think Heaney has done all this? Explain in your own words.\nImportant: People sometimes get stuck here. To support yourself here: Look back at the writing you did earlier. There is a good chance - if you are patient and prepared to think that something you thought or wrote earlier will help you here - something to do with what the poem is about. 4. Why this poem now? (REFLECT) Paragraph written? If so — well done. You probably had to think hard and expend effort, didn’t you?\nYou can put your pen down now. But I’d like you to consider the following - as a way of winding down and giving broader meaning to what we’ve just done:\nI often teach this poem at the end of the year.\nWhy do you think that is?\nWhat kind of ‘bridge’ has the speaker crossed?\nWhat bridges have you crossed this year — at school, with friends or family, in your life?\nAnd finally: did any of the words you picked from the word lists help to act as a ‘bridge’ for you today? Can you explain how?\n5. Conclusion The purpose of the routine we’ve just been through is to illustrate that poetry analysis is not about decoding; it’s about recognition. It’s about noticing what you almost understand — and finding the words to bring it closer.\nThat’s not just a reading skill. It’s a life skill.\nLet me know how you get on.\n","wordCount":"1478","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-05T23:00:13Z","dateModified":"2025-07-05T23:00:13Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mortworks.github.io/teach-blog/posts/advancement-of-learning-end-of-year/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"PWM Teach-Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mortworks.github.io/teach-blog/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mortworks.github.io/teach-blog/ accesskey=h title="PWM Teach-Blog (Alt + H)">PWM Teach-Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Crossing the Bridge: How to think (and write) about a poem</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-07-05 23:00:13 +0000 UTC'>5 July 2025

What effect does the imagery have?</p><p><strong>Option 4:</strong><br>Choose two stanzas of your own and write about what you find interesting or effective.</p><h4 id=structure-your-paragraph-like-this>Structure your paragraph like this:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#structure-your-paragraph-like-this>#</a></h4><blockquote><p><strong>WHAT:</strong> <strong>Clear main point</strong> that answers the question you chose – you want <em>everything that comes next</em> to support/demonstrate this point!</p><p><strong>HOW:</strong> <strong>Example 1:</strong></p><p><em><strong>For example…</strong></em> – then offer your first quotation:</p><ul><li>Try to explain <em>why</em> your example is important – using technical detail if possible.</li></ul><p><strong>HOW:</strong> <strong>Example 2:</strong></p><p><strong>“Similarly…”</strong> – now introduce another quotation to reinforce your main point</p><ul><li>Again, try to explain <em>why</em> your example is important – using technical detail
if possible.</li></ul><p><strong>HOW:</strong> <strong>Example 3</strong> (if you can):</p><p><strong>“Furthermore”</strong> – see if you can throw in a further piece of evidence that supports your main idea.</p><ul><li>Once again, try to explain why your example is important – using technical detail if possible.</li></ul><p><strong>WHY</strong>: <strong>Explain</strong> <em>why</em> do you think Heaney has done all this? Explain in your own words.</p><ul><li><strong>Important:</strong> People sometimes get stuck here. To support yourself here:<ul><li><em>Look back at the writing you did earlier</em>. There is a good chance - if you are patient and prepared <em>to think</em> that <em>something</em> you thought or wrote earlier will help you here - something to do with what the poem is <em>about</em>.</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><hr><h3 id=4-why-this-poem-now-reflect><strong>4. Why this poem now? (REFLECT)</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#4-why-this-poem-now-reflect>#</a></h3><p>Paragraph written? If so &mdash; well done.
