<!-- intro-commentary -->
This poem is a brilliant way to end the year: it’s short, vivid, and full of raw tension.  
It shows Heaney confronting fear — not just of rats, but of growing up.

<!-- closing-thoughts -->
Now try to apply the WHAT / HOW / WHY method to another poem you’ve studied this year.  
Can you identify a moment of transformation or confrontation?
