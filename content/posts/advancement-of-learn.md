**Title: Crossing the Bridge: How to think (and write) about a poem**

This is a poem I like to teach **towards the end of an academic year.** If *you're* reading this near to the end of an academic year, then...

...you're standing at **a kind of bridge** — 

one between *this* year and next.

So let's read a poem about a boy who crosses a **literal** bridge, after facing something that he's always feared.

This is [**Seamus Heaney's 'An Advancement of Learning'**](https://www.brinkerhoffpoetry.org/poems/an-advancement-of-learning) — and it's a brilliant poem to end the year on.

But first---read the poem. **Just read it.** Silently once, then aloud if you can. Take in:
* the rhythms
* the changes
* the final image

Feel your way through it. There's a version of it [here](https://www.brinkerhoffpoetry.org/poems/an-advancement-of-learning).

Have you read it now? Great:

Now, grab a notebook, *something to write on* — something offline if possible. This blog post is your guide, your structure, your worksheet. Follow it actively: write headings, jot down thoughts, underline what matters.

Case in point: **Give yourself a title.** You could just title this note *'An Advancement of Learning' by Seamus Heaney*.

Now here is your first subtitle, because we're going to begin with a very important question 👇

----------

### **1. What's it about? (WHAT)**

That's your subtitle, by the way 👆: "What's it about?" Did I mention that? Write it down.

#### Generating initial ideas

Now here's your first 'engagement' with the poem. I'm going to ask you to *write* something.

**In your own words:** what do you think this poem is about?

Be *fearless* here. Just write. You can start by being *literal* - and maybe you will branch out into something more adventurous. Just write: nobody is judging you here. The only person going to be doing the judging is *you*.

How much? **Aim for 100 words.** If that sounds like a lot then do what you can. Then come back here.

Done now? Got something written down? If so - we can move onto the next stage... [So here is your next subtitle 👇]

#### Enhancing your ideas

Got that? Written it down? 👆

Now - *this is where the magic happens*:

**Let’s better define your thinking:**

1. **Browse the word lists below**
2.  **Jot down** any words which you think are a **good fit** in identifying *something* that is *in* the poem.
3. When you're done, continue to the next section (below the word list).

##### Word lists to promote sharper thinking:

**Challenge**: fear, confrontation, anxiety, ordeal, courage, humiliation  
**Control**: tension, force, constraint, pressure, loss of control  
**Emotion**: disgust, anger, shame, relief, triumph  
**Maturity**: advancement, rite of passage, initiation, threshold, transformation  
**Conflict**: resistance, deadlock, defiance, surrender, domination  
**Power**: authority, assertion, submission, encounter, standoff  
**Growth**: awakening, self-knowledge, self-possession, insight, clarity

#### Revising and improving your answer

Got your list of 'good fit' words written down? Good. Now *write out the subtitle above*. **We're building a meaningful set of notes** that you can consult later on - to **remember the thinking process** we went through.

*Now* have **a fresh go** at summarising *what the poem is about*.

##### Tips:
1. You might find it helpful to ask this time:
   > "What's it *really* about?"
  
2. Try to work into your writing **some of the fresh vocabulary** you've just identified.

#### Reflecting on how your answer changed - and why
**Reflect:**
* *How* did your second answer change?
* Is it better?
* Which of the 'new' words did you use?
* Which version feels *closer to the truth*?
* Which was easier to write — and why?

**Other useful questions to ask here are:**
* Were the 'new' words you used really 'new'? Did you know them already?
* What *prevented* you from using them in the first place?

That last question isn't supposed to sound rhetorical or judgmental---it's a genuine question. You might feel that the answer is:
> I don't really know - I just didn't think of it... But now I know that 'conflict' is a thing that appears in poetry, maybe I'll be better at spotting one next time?

And that would be a win!

#### Ready to move on

We've now done something crucial:

**We've established some of the things that the poem is *really* about.**
* We haven't treated it like a crossword puzzle or a code.
* We haven't looked for any 'hidden meanings'.

We've just used ordinary English words that felt like a 'good fit' for what's *going on* and *what we're seeing* in the poem.

**In other words, we have established the poem's *content*.**

So here is your next subtitle: 👇

----------

### **2. How is the content presented? (HOW)**

Got your subtitle written down? 👆

Now that you've got a proper grasp of the actual *content* and *meaning* of the poem, let's have a look at how that content is *shaped* and *dramatised* through poetic style.

This is the bit that we might call 'looking for techniques'.

> This activity is nicer if you can get hold of **a paper copy** of [the poem](https://www.brinkerhoffpoetry.org/poems/an-advancement-of-learning) (or screenshot and annotate it on a device): *Otherwise*, you can write your notes like this (I've gifted you a few here!):
> 
> * **Imagery:** "A transfer of gables and sky"
> * **Onomatopoeia:** "slobbered", "slimed"
> * **Alliteration:** "**c**urtly, **c**lose"  

This is where you apply all the tools you've been taught in the past---use them!

Try to get at least 10 different technical observations.

Done that? Then you're ready to move onto the next phase - where we explore how those techniques are effective or meaningful *in the context of all the ideas we generated **about the content.***

Get that subtitle written down! 👇


----------

### **3. Bring it all together (WHAT > HOW > WHY)**

This is what we've really been building up to---the bit where we say something meaningful about the poem AND explain how it's made effective and dramatic.

#### Time to write
Choose one of the four paragraph prompts (below). They all focus on different parts of the poem.
> * Use the paragraph *scaffolding* provided further below
> * Be focused and **economical**
> * Aim for **120–150 words**
> * Don't forget to make use of your thinking from **both** the previous steps we have been through!
> * Did you read that last bullet point? You *have* to build on the thinking you've already done: **this is where lots of people fall down.**

#### Paragraph prompts:

**Option 1 (Stanzas 3 & 4):**  
How does Heaney *characterise* his *initial detection* and *reaction* to the rat? (e.g. thoughts, feelings, behaviour)

**Option 2 (Stanza 5):**  
How does Heaney make his *behaviour* and *attitude* *seem* here? Could this be a turning point?

**Option 3 (Stanzas 6 & 7):**  
How does Heaney present *the appearance* of the rat? What effect does the imagery have?

**Option 4:**  
Choose two stanzas of your own and write about what you find interesting or effective.

#### Structure your paragraph like this:

> **WHAT:** **Clear main point**  that answers the  question you chose – you want *everything that comes next* to support/demonstrate this point!
> 
> **HOW:** **Example 1:**
> 
> ***For example…*** – then offer your first quotation:
> 
> * Try to explain *why* your example is important – using technical detail if possible.
> 
> **HOW:** **Example 2:**
> 
> **“Similarly…”** – now introduce another quotation to reinforce your main point
> 
>  * Again, try to explain *why* your example is important – using technical detail
> if possible.
> 
> **HOW:** **Example 3**  (if you can):
> 
> **“Furthermore”** – see if you can throw in a further piece of evidence that supports your main idea.
> 
> * Once again, try to explain why your example is important – using technical detail if possible.
> 
> **WHY**: **Explain** *why* do you think Heaney has done all this? Explain in your own words.
> * **Important:** People sometimes get stuck here. To support yourself here:
>   * *Look back at the writing you did earlier*. There is a good chance - if you are patient and prepared *to think* that *something* you thought or wrote earlier will help you here - something to do with what the poem is *about*.

### **4. Why this poem now? (REFLECT)**

Paragraph written? If so --- well done. You probably had to think hard and expend effort, didn't you?

You can put your pen down now. But I'd like you to consider the following - as a way of winding down and giving broader meaning to what we've just done:

I often teach this poem at the end of the year.

*Why do you think that is?*

* What kind of 'bridge' has the speaker crossed?

* What bridges have you crossed this year --- at school, with friends or family, in your life?

* And finally: did any of the words you picked from the word lists help to act as a 'bridge' for you today? Can you explain how?

----------
### 5. Conclusion
The purpose of the routine we've just been through is to illustrate that **poetry analysis is not about decoding; it's about *recognition*.** It’s about noticing what you *almost* understand — and finding the words to bring it closer.

That’s not just a reading skill. It’s a life skill.

Let me know how you get on.
