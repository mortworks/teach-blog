Welcome to my teaching resources site.

✍️ *This is a hand-tooled resource for curious learners. Most of it was written with pupils in mind—but it's designed to be useful for teachers, developers, and anyone who likes clarity and rigour.*

💡 You’ll find structured guidance on essay writing, exploratory work in coding and AI, and a library of live-tested material from a classroom that believes in thinking hard and writing well.
