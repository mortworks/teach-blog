### How to structure your analytical paragraph

This scaffold helps you build a strong, clear paragraph when you're writing about a poem or a passage of text. It's not a formula — it's a *framework*. You can bend it, stretch it, remix it. But learn it first.

#### 🟩 **WHAT** — Make your point

Begin with a clear statement that sums up your main idea. Try to use one or two abstract nouns (e.g. *fear*, *growth*, *dominance*, *conflict*) to give your point some weight.

> *Heaney presents the speaker’s reaction to the rat as a test of his growing self-control and maturity.*

#### 🟨 **HOW — Example 1**

Introduce your first piece of evidence with:

* *For example…*
* *We see this in the line…*

Then quote and explain:

> *“The river nosed past” uses personification to make the setting feel uneasy and alive — like it's watching.*

#### 🟨 **HOW — Example 2**

Build on your point with:

* *Similarly…*
* *Another way this is shown…*

Add another quotation and explain its effect:

> *Similarly, the rat is described as “nimble”, suggesting threat but also a strange grace — something the speaker must reckon with.*

#### 🟨 **HOW — Example 3 (optional)**

If you can, add a third piece of support:

* *Furthermore…*
* *Another detail that reinforces this…*

> *Furthermore, the speaker says “I turned to stare”, which shows a shift from fear to confrontation.*

#### 🟥 **WHY — Wrap up**

Step back. Why has the writer done this? What's the effect or deeper idea?

> *Heaney uses these images to show the moment the speaker begins to overcome fear. The rat becomes less of a monster, more of a mirror.*
